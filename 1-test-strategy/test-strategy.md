# E-Commerce Test Strategy

## Test Objectives
- Verify core e-commerce functionality works correctly
- Ensure user workflows are smooth and intuitive
- Validate data integrity across user journeys
- Identify and document defects in demo environments

## Scope
### In-Scope Features
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Product catalog and search
- Shopping cart operations
- Checkout process
- Form validations and error handling

### Test Types
- Functional Testing
- Regression Testing  
- UI Testing
- Usability Testing

## Test Environments
- **Sauce Demo** (saucedemo.com)
- **Automation Practice** (automationpractice.com)
- **DemoQA** (demoqa.com)

## Test Approach
### Phase 1: Smoke Testing
- Verify critical paths work
- Test login, product display, basic cart operations

### Phase 2: Functional Testing  
- Detailed testing of all features
- Positive and negative test scenarios
- Boundary value analysis

### Phase 3: Regression Testing
- Re-test fixed defects
- Verify existing functionality not broken

## Entry Criteria
- Test environments available and stable
- Test data prepared
- Test cases reviewed and approved

## Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases executed
- No critical defects open
- Test results documented
- Test summary report completed

## Risk Assessment
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Demo site unavailable | High | Low | Use multiple backup sites |
| Test data issues | Medium | Medium | Prepare validated test data |
| Environment changes | Medium | Low | Document baseline behavior |

## Defect Management
- Defects logged with clear reproduction steps
- Severity and priority assigned
- Screenshots attached where applicable
- Track defect resolution status

## Test Deliverables
- Test strategy document
- Test cases and results
- Defect reports
- Test summary report
- Test metrics
